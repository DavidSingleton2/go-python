Welcome to the Go Game Guru's Virtual Go Program! This program aims to teach
you the basics of Go, as well as simulate the experience of playing go against
a real player.
While go may seem complicated, it has rather simple rules. Play occurs as 
follows:
1.  Go is a board game between to players, black and white.
2.  Go is usually played on a 19x19 Grid. A player may place a stone on an
    intersection, denoted by a '✛' in the game. Intersections are said to be 
    adjacent if they are orthagonally positioned next to each other.
3.  Go is played with stones, denoted as '⚫' and '⚪' in the game. Each player
    has an unlimited amount of stones.
4.  At any time, an intersection is either unoccupied, occupied by a black,
    or occupied by a white stone.
5.  Stones are consisdered connected if it is possible to draw a path between
    them only moving orthagonally and only encountering stones of the same 4
    colour.
6.  A liberty is an empty, unoccupied intersection immediately adjacent to a 
   stone or group of stones.

7.  The board starts empty.
8.  Black moves first. Following this first move, the players alternate.
9.  On their turn, a player may either pass or play. A play consists of the
    the following steps.
    a. Placing a stone of their colour at an empty intersection
    b. Removing from the board any stones/stone groups of their opponents 
       colour which have no liberties.
    c. Removing from the board any stone/stone groups of their own colour which
       have no liberties.
   Important Note: The Go Game Guru Software automatically removes stones with
   no remaining errors.
10. A play is considered illegal if:
    a. The play does not remove the opponents stones and instead exclusively
       removes the stones of the player.
    b. The play recreates an indentical board state which has previously 
       occurred.
11. Play ends when there are no remaining plays or both players pass 
    consecutively
